/**
 * EXE-01 — the small amount of shell state that is *not* in the database, and
 * the rule that keeps it small.
 *
 * Everything that matters about a workout is already persisted: the session
 * row carries `started_at`, the prescriptions carry their execution status,
 * the set logs are written as they happen (EXE-02) and `block_results` is
 * written at block completion. Closing the tab loses none of it, which is why
 * the requirement can say the trap is on in-app navigation and not on the
 * user — and why there is no `beforeunload` handler anywhere in this feature.
 * Asking "are you sure you want to leave?" would be the app protecting state
 * it has already saved, at the cost of the one exit the user is entitled to.
 *
 * What is left is where they were *looking*: which section the shell had open.
 * The database cannot answer that — section four being untouched does not mean
 * the user had not scrolled to it — so it is written to `localStorage`, keyed
 * by session id, and restored when the same session is re-entered. It is a
 * convenience, and it is treated like one: an unreadable, unparsable or
 * foreign-session record is simply ignored, and the shell falls back to the
 * first unfinished section derived from the rows.
 *
 * No zod here. CORE-03's rule is that every payload crossing a *process*
 * boundary is parsed in `schemas.ts`; this crosses no process, and its own
 * previous write is the only thing that produces it. A hand-written guard is
 * the honest size of the problem.
